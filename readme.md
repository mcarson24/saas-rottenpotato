## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework. The [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) is thorough, complete, and makes it a breeze to get started learning the framework.

# Modifying RottenPotatoes

## Rails Intro: add features to RottenPotatoes

In this homework you will add a feature to an existing simple Rails app and deploy the result publicly on the Heroku cloud hosting service. We will run live integration tests against your deployed version.

General advice: This homework involves modifying RottenPotatoes in various ways. Git is your friend: commit frequently in case you inadvertently break something that was working before! That way you can always back up to an earlier revision, or just visually compare what changed in each file since your last “good” commit.

**Remember, commit early and often!**

## Assignment Contents

  - Part 0 (A): Preparation: [get RottenPotatoes running locally](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro/blob/master/docs/part_0_A.md)
  - Part 0 (B): Preparation: [deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro/blob/master/docs/part_0_B.md)
  - Part 1: [Sort the list of movies (15 points)](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro/blob/master/docs/part_1.md)
  - Part 2: [Filter the list of movies by rating (15 points)](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro/blob/master/docs/part_2.md)
  - Part 3: [Remember the sorting and filtering settings (70 points)](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rails-intro/blob/master/docs/part_3.md)

## How to submit when you're all done

Deploying your finished app to Heroku by the homework deadline is part of the grading process. Even if you have code checked in that works properly, you still need to also deploy it to Heroku to get full credit.

Once you're confident the functionality works correctly on Heroku, submit the URI of your deployed Heroku app in a text file with no other contents.

**Please be careful** to use **http** and not **https**, that is, submit `http://your-app.herokuapp.com` and NOT `https://your-app.herokuapp.com`.
